Sure! Based on your configuration, we can summarize practical tests in a table format. I’ll include the request path/method, browser action, and expected server behavior.

#	Request	                Method	Browser Action / Test	Expected Behavior
1	/	                    GET	    Open root URL	        Server returns index.html from www/
2	/upload 	            GET	    Navigate to upload page	Since autoindex=on, directory listing of www/uploads/ is returned
3	/upload	                POST	Submit file upload form	File is stored in www/uploads/, server responds 200/created
4	/uploads	            GET	    Access uploaded files	Server serves static files from www/uploads/, autoindex enabled
5	/uploads/file.txt	    GET	    Access specific file	Server serves file content
6	/redirect-me	        GET	    Navigate to redirect	Server returns HTTP 301 redirect to http://lavenderwebfr.com/
7	/cgi-bin/hello.php	    GET	    Open PHP script	        Server executes PHP via /usr/bin/php-cgi, returns output
8	/cgi-bin/hello.php	    POST	POST request	        If method allowed, execute PHP CGI; otherwise 405 Method Not Allowed
9	/scripts/test.py	    GET	    Open Python script	    Server executes Python CGI via /usr/bin/python3, returns output
10	/scripts/test.py	    POST	POST data to script	    Server executes Python CGI with POST data
11	/cgi-bin/missing.php	GET	    Non-existent PHP	    Server returns 404 Not Found
12	/scripts/missing.py	    GET	    Non-existent Python	    Server returns 404 Not Found
13	/upload/missing	        GET	    Non-existent file	    Server returns 404 Not Found
14	/	                    POST	Try POST on root	    Method not allowed → 405
15	/redirect-me/anything	GET	    Sub-path	            Redirect applied only to /redirect-me itself unless wildcard allowed → typically 404 or handled by location matching
16	/uploads/	            GET	    Access folder	        Autoindex enabled → show folder contents
17	/cgi-bin/	            GET	    Acess folder no file	If index set (hello.php), execute hello.php
18	/scripts/	            GET	    Access folder	        No index, autoindex off → 403 Forbidden or 404

Notes / clarifications:

autoindex on allows viewing directory contents when no index file exists.

index specifies the default file to serve when requesting a directory path.

redirect always returns HTTP 3xx before attempting any file access.

CGI execution (cgi_extension + cgi_pass) applies only to matching file extensions.

allow_methods restricts HTTP methods; disallowed methods return 405.

max_body_size limits POST/PUT payloads (uploads).
