Step 1 — Understanding the program flow

Parse arguments → width, height, iterations.
Initialize the board → all cells dead.
Read commands from stdin → move pen and mark cells alive while the pen is down.
Simulate Game of Life for the given number of iterations.
Print final board with 'O' for alive and ' ' for dead.

Step 2 — Game of Life rules

For each cell:
Alive cell survives if it has 2 or 3 alive neighbors.
Dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly 3 alive neighbors.
Otherwise, it becomes dead.
Neighbors are counted only inside the board — outside cells are considered dead.

echo 'dxss' | ./a.out 3 3 0

(0,0) pen up → all cells DEAD

'd' 'x' 's' 's'
